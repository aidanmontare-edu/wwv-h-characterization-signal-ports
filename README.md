# WWV/H Characterization Signal Ports

This project contains ports of the code used to generate the WWV/H Characterization Signal (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5602094).

Because different languages may make use of different random number generators, the results of these ports may not be bitwise-identical to the original version. However, the noise should still have the same properties.
